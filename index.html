  <!-- <h2>Richard Coulson (Senior Front-end Developer)</h2> -->
  <!--
  When you spend more coding instead of designing, it becomes clear where your passion lies.
  I am a front-end developer.
  My proefessional experience has always been balanced between design and code. But my love for science has probably pushed me deep into tryign to become a well rounded developer who wants to focus on writing clean, testable code using industry best practices.
  My ideal next role would be working on a tech product within a team of developers who openly act to teach, inspire each other to push the team to its fullest.
  I know how a good product life-cycle works. I know how the research conducted by UX is translated through to dev-ready UI designs. I know how the pitfalls that can be made and actively aim to help project through to launch.
  So feel free to take some time to have a look through some of my projects below
